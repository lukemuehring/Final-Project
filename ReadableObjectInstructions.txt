Steps to make a readable object:

1. Create trigger object
- GameObject > 3D Object > Cube
- position cube so that it encompasses the object, tilted slightly up towards the player POV (see example). 
- turn OFF mesh renderer for the trigger

2. Group object and its trigger
- select both objects
- GameObject > Create Empty Parent

3. Make image
- GameObject > UI > Image or just duplicate an existing image
- Add image as texture, adjusting as necessary so that it displays nicely on the screen
- Deactivate/uncheck the image!!!

4. Drag ReadableObject Script onto TRIGGER CUBE! NOT the object itself or its parent

5. Set variables using inspector panel
- object to read = object itself, not the trigger or its parent
- image to display = image
- "The Distance" and "Is Displayed" are just for debugging, do not change these
